<h2>Defination</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science in which <b>"natural intelligence mimics on machine."</b>It is opposite to natural intelligence displayed by human and animals.<b>John McCarthy</b> is the father of Artificial Intelligence. </p>
<h2>Components of AI</h2>
<p>There are four components of AI</p>

	<th>Components</th>
	<th>Defination</th>
	<tr>
		<td>Think like human</td>
		<td><p> Artificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are specifically modelled on how the human brain works. We refer to these as 'thinking machines' even though they don't think in the way that humans do.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Act like Human</td>
		<td><p>A program must be able to act sufficiently like a human to fool an interrogator. A human interrogates the program and another human via a terminal simultaneously. </p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Think Rationally</td>
		<td><p>The “thinking rationally” approach to AI uses symbolic logic to capture the laws of rational thought as symbols that can be manipulated. Reasoning involves manipulating the symbols according to well-defined rules, kind of like algebra. The result is an idealized model of human reasoning.</p></td>
	</tr>
	    <td>Act Rationally</td>
        <td><p>Acting rationally means acting so as to achieve one's goals, given one's beliefs. An agent is just something that perceives and acts. In the logical approach to AI, the emphasis is on correct inferences.</p></td>
