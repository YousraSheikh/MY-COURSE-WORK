<h2>Defination</h2>

					<li><h3>Domain Name</h3></li>
					<p>A domain name is the web address of your site. This is what makes it easily identifiable and findable online.Domain names have to be purchased through official domain registrars as no two domain names can be exactly the same.Often, domain names are the same as a brand name.

These are often the simplest form of website to create as they do not require any form of flexibility. Any website type can be static, it simply requires greater upkeep should you choose to make a change to your site.</p>
<li><h3>Dynamic Website</h3></li></ol>

These might include who is accessing the pages, when they are being accessed, and more. This strategy is often used by large websites since the maintenance is lower.  For example an <b>E-Commerce</b> website with a shopping cart would have to be dynamic as it changes per user. </p>
